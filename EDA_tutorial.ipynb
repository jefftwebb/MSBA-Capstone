        "- Is the daily frequency of visits as expected, or are there anomalies that need further investigation? \n",
        "- Is the range of the variables resonable or do there appear to be mistakes? In particular, given the definition of a visit do the distributions of variables like visits, hits, pageViews and bounces make logical sense?\n",
        "- Are there columns without any (or with very little) variation? (If so, we will want to remove them, as they contain little or no information.) \n",

        "- What is the distribution of `transactionRevenue`? In particular: Skewed? Zero-inflated? How rare is purchasing?\n",
        "\n",

The purpose here is to do informal modeling via exploratory analysis in preparation for confirmatory analysis later on. At this stage you want to explore hypotheses about why people decide to buy, or about the process that leads to buying. For example:\n",

The process may feel a little bit like looking for a needle in a haystack, but you can limit the questions by thinking about possible drivers of purchasing. For example, a large number of page views suggests that a customer is looking for something, and might therefore be more likely to purchase. At this stage, also, you may think of questions that would require new or different data to answer. Get creative about engineering new features to answer such questions. \n"
